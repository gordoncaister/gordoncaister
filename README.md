### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am Gordon Caister I am a full stack engineer. 

I was born in South Africa and lived there until I was 21. I moved to Canada and the USA shortly thereafter. In Canada I worked as an outdoor educator. In the USA I worked in the Video Gaming industry, and then I worked as a Salesforce developer for an energy efficiency startup.

My main stacks is React, Node, Express and PostgreSQL.
My language choices are Python, Javascript, HTML, CSS and SQL
I have experience with Angular, Typescript, Salesforce click-to-code tools as well as its proprietary languages and Apex.

I'm currently working on:
  - an agnostic inventory management app for mobile using React Native
  - an 8 week long, team project for Lambda School
  - volunteering React skills for the Milwaukee Codes - Milwaukee Decarceration Program
  - volunteering Python skills and CRM experience for [NexTo](https://digitalpublicworks.com/p/nexto)

I'm currently learning React Native

I am currently looking for a position appropriate for someone at the dawn of their career.
